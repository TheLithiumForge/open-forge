# CLI Development Checkpoint

## Goal

Complete the replacement CLI from its accepted Architecture and command
contracts, with safe local development, reproducible evidence, and no partial
release.

## Current State

Find, References, Context, and Extension List are Complete. Context is
squash-integrated into local `develop` at `ca097a2`, and Extension List is
squash-integrated at current clean baseline `db0d39a`. The final tree exactly
matches the rebased Extension List integration tip `5e6babf` and retains both
Context and Extension List composition and source-generated JSON registration.

The combined accepted baseline passes locked restore, warning-free Release
build, format verification, managed Unit `978/978`, Integration `354/354`, and
EndToEnd `111/111`, all with zero skips. The supported local `linux-x64` Native
AOT root publishes and executes both commands; Native AOT Integration is
`354/354` and EndToEnd is `111/111`, with zero skips. Final independent Context
and Extension List correctness reviews found no material issues. No remote
action or push occurred.

Implemented boundaries:

- Repository-root `OpenForge.Cli.slnx`, SDK, NuGet, and shared MSBuild files.
- Root `/artifacts/` for .NET binary, intermediate, test, publish, and package
  output.
- Automatic managed `open-forge-dev` publication from an ordinary non-RID CLI
  project build, including solution and EndToEnd dependency builds, with one
  explicit MSBuild opt-out.
- Environment-free EndToEnd discovery. Ordinary builds select the development
  publication; CI and native evidence compile the EndToEnd project with one
  supported target RID and no executable-path override.
- Linux and WSL portability corrections for symlink cleanup and file-sharing
  classification.
- Removal of the obsolete preserved route-list suite after its only unique
  empty-YAML expectation moved into active Integration evidence.
- Temporary Index and References compatibility-name routes and Task filenames,
  pending replacement Index validation of their final names.

The Ubuntu SDK installation exposes a distro-specific `ubuntu.24.04-x64` local
AOT pack, while the accepted product RID remains portable `linux-x64`. With exact
restore authority, standard SDK publication restored
`Microsoft.NETCore.App.Runtime.NativeAOT.linux-x64` `10.0.11` from the configured
NuGet source and produced the native root without a project workaround. The
explicit `linux-x64` build passed with zero warnings and errors; build-selected
References EndToEnd passed `12/12`; Native AOT Integration passed `308/308`; and
Native AOT EndToEnd passed `82/82`, all with zero skips. No global installation,
external publication, remote action, or push occurred.

## Current Step

Freeze and execute the authorized two-lane wave from one reconciled baseline:

1. close Extension Inspect's exact command-local result/finding/fingerprint
   contract before production implementation; and
2. establish the pure read-only `Framework/GeneratedNavigation` foundation with
   no command, lock, write, recovery, root registration, or JSON surface.

Public Index application and Mutation Foundation remain sequential. Do not start
either until their current dependency-order contradiction is resolved in the
accepted Architecture and Plan. Do not push.

## Protected State

- Do not stage or alter unrelated `.apm` and `apm.lock.yaml` worktree changes.
- Do not edit sealed Handoffs or archived evidence to rewrite history.
- Do not change accepted Find, References, Context, Extension List, Route, Shell,
  or source-reference meaning during the wave.
- Do not implement public Index selection, binding, application, locking,
  recovery, Git policy, or result presentation in the Generated Navigation lane.
- Do not download additional dependencies without exact authorization.
- Do not contact remotes, publish, globally install, deploy, or push.

## Next Actions

1. Integrate this reconciled coordination boundary and branch both isolated lanes
   from its exact commit.
2. Run the two bounded Task Masterminds with task-local reviewers, integrate only
   accepted candidates, and keep remotes unchanged.
3. Return the proposed Extension Inspect public contract and the Index/Mutation
   ordering correction for project-level acceptance before dependent production.

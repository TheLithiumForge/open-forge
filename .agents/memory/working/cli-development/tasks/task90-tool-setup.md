# Tool setup

Tool setup is Task 90, which implements published tool installation and additive configuration through supervised lanes.
For example, bare Install restores the exact lock versions while tools run through their direct commands.

Status: Task 90 “Tool setup” (phase 1/3): milestone 0/7.

## Outcome

Implement the [Tool setup design](../../../crystallized/documents/cli/technical-designs/tool-setup.md), updated by the maintainer's [round-2 decisions](https://github.com/TheLithiumForge/open-forge/issues/23#issuecomment-6868316792).
The detailed 14 November 2026 source is `of-tool-setup-decisions-2.md`.
It overrides the earlier respec.
Report and stop after each of the user's three phases.

## Milestones

Complete these milestones in order:

1. Fold round 2 into the spec, schemas, shared types and outlines, verify and commit.
2. Freeze strict lane packets and create one worktree per worker.
3. Start the Worker Watch lanes and report Phase 2.
4. Integrate A through D with local no-fast-forward merges and focused checks.
5. Complete E's catalogue entries, Windows journeys and user docs.
6. Run one fresh adherence review and close every gap.
7. Request hosted CI through the overseer and resolve every reported failure.

## Execution

Phase 1 is direct work by the mastermind.
Phase 2 uses `gpt-6.1-sol` with `xhigh` effort through Worker Watch in PowerShell.
The user's model choice overrides the older workspace roster.
Each worker has its own worktree and strict file assignment.
The mastermind integrates shared composition and final payload snapshots.
The user authorizes local lane merges, overriding the lane file's earlier no-merge rule.
No worker pushes, opens a PR or changes GitHub.

## Evidence

Phase 1 changes documents, schemas and compile-only types. Git keeps the previous tracked files.
The normal BCL and existing dependencies cover these data shapes. No exceptional mechanism is chosen.
Use a managed build, touched tests, formatting, Markdown links, the site build and both .NET checks.
Full suites and Native AOT run in CI. A local NU1903 override stays on the invocation.
Implementation handles developer files and native account effects.
Tests use owned temporary homes. Windows journeys use temporary repositories under D:.
Never modify real shell profiles or persistent user PATH during those journeys.
Tools add no workspace state, lease or recovery dependency under `.open-forge-state/`.

## Checkpoint

Done: Loaded round 2, the lane rules and applicable Open Forge context.
Now: Task 90 “Tool setup” (phase 1/3): milestone 0/7. Updating the spec and shared shapes.
Next: Verify and commit Phase 1, then stop with its report.
Blocker: None. Reversible choices are recorded for review.

## Runs

No Worker Watch agent or run has started for this task.
